# Pair Programming

Pair programming keeps both programmers fully aware of what is happening in the code. It encourages communication and is a direct implementation of the idea that "two heads are better than one."

Pair programming happens by having two developers share one computer to get the work done. If someone is working remotely, they can screen-share, as well.

## Remote Pair Programming

To get started download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). 

Once you have VSCode set up, select the "Extensions" tab on the mini-bar on the left. Search for "Live Share". You should see "Live Share" and "Live Share Extension Pack" extensions. Install both of them. Both extensions will have instructions on how to install and use them.

Visual Studio Live Share enables you to collaboratively edit and debug with others in real time, regardless what programming languages you're using or app types you're building. It allows you to instantly (and securely) share your current project, and then as needed, share debugging sessions, terminal instances, localhost web apps, voice calls, and more!

Visual Studio Extension Pack This extension pack includes everything you need to start collaboratively editing and debugging in real time, including integrated audio and text chat.
